        The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places
        and at the wrong times; premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming

    <p>
      So I’ve recently gotten the urge to tinker around with my website / blog (which really has only existed as a
      development playground up to this point, seeing as I’ve only ever written a handful of small posts across the
      years). The past several weeks I did a survey of the most popular website stacks — everything from the classic
      (and overwhelming at this point) <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> platform to the <a
        href="https://jekyllrb.com/">many</a> <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">nerd</a> / <a
        href="https://gohugo.io/">developer-centric</a> “markdown-to-static” site generators to
      newer contenders like <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are perfectly acceptable solutions in their own ways, but honestly, they all seem to have way more features
      than I need (vastly increasing the layers of complexity when there is something that I <i>do</i> want to tweak).
      Additionally, I’ve found that having a monolithic build system in place kind of shields me from what I as a
      software developer want — a holistic understanding of everything that is happening when I write and publish
      something online.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, there is always going to be a certain level after which I no longer understand what’s happening.
      Whatever intricate webserver code GitHub Pages is using to serve this page, and the CDN caching happening behind
      the scenes
      is far beyond what I can look into for right now. But as a primarily web-centric software guy, I do feel a strange
      sense of duty to be conscious of as many of the actual bits that I send up to the server as I reasonably can.
    </p>
    <p>
      To that end, I’ve embarked on a journey for trentshell.com to start from the ground up and only add a file as it’s
      needed. As of this writing, I have an index.html file, this document I’ve written now, a shared styles.css file, a
      CNAME file to configure the domain, and an atom.xml since an RSS subscription mechanism seems like table stakes
      for any website which can be updated with new content.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> New posts will be
      added in bare HTML. No templating, No build
      step, no Markdown conversion process. Of course, there may come a time when it makes sense to add those features,
      but
      that decision will be made when I have more history to evaluate the real time / efficiency tradeoff.
    </p>
    <p>
      What do I hope to gain by typing angle brackets like an animal? A greater understanding of and attention to HTML
      best practices and standard-compliant markup, for one. A quicker deployment process if I go for months without
      touching this site again without needing to re-learn how to run whatever static site generator is being run under
      the hood. Mostly, though? All the serious street-cred that will come by me telling people that I update my website
      in the old-world, hand-crafted, artisanal manner.

          <p>I’ve also decided that for my RSS feed, I’m going to go with the summary of the article in
            the feed along with a link to the entry. This is in line with this philosophy of the source of truth being
            the actual HTML file served to the user — if I correct a typo, make an update, or add a comment, I’d like to
            only have to do that in a single place.</p>
          <p>Additionally, whenever I’m reading something online, I do like knowing that I’m
            seeing all the content as it was intended to be shown, which can sometimes be tricky to replicate in a feed
            reader.</p>
          <p>Of course, there are plenty of feed readers with the feature which will automatically extract
            the full text, and I’m totally fine with that. I just don’t want to do that step myself.<a href="#ref1"
