            The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong
            places and at the wrong times; premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it)
            programming

        So I’ve recently gotten the urge to tinker around with my website / blog (which really has only existed as a
        development playground up to this point, seeing as I’ve only ever written a handful of small posts across the
        years). The past several weeks I did a survey of the most popular website stacks — everything from the classic
        (and overwhelming at this point) <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> platform to the <a
            href="https://jekyllrb.com/">many</a> <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">nerd</a> / <a
            href="https://gohugo.io/">developer-centric</a> “markdown-to-static” site generators to newer contenders
        like <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        These are perfectly acceptable solutions in their own ways, but honestly, they all seem to have way more
        features than I need (vastly increasing the layers of complexity when there is something that I <i>do</i> want
        to tweak). Additionally, I’ve found that having a monolithic build system in place kind of shields me from what
        I as a software developer want — a holistic understanding of everything that is happening when I write and
        publish something online.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, there is always going to be a certain level after which I no longer understand what’s happening.
        Whatever intricate webserver code GitHub Pages is using to serve this page, and the CDN caching happening behind
        the scenes is far beyond what I can look into for right now. But as a primarily web-centric software guy, I do
        feel a strange sense of duty to be conscious of as many of the actual bits that I send up to the server as I
        reasonably can.
    </p>
    <p>
        To that end, I’ve embarked on a journey for trentshell.com to start from the ground up and only add a file as
        it’s needed. As of this writing, I have an index.html file, this document I’ve written now, a shared styles.css
        file, a CNAME file to configure the domain, and an atom.xml since an RSS subscription mechanism seems like table
        stakes for any website which can be updated with new content. New posts will be added in bare HTML. No
        templating, No build step, no Markdown conversion process. Of course, there may come a time when it makes sense
        to add those features, but that decision will be made when I have more history to evaluate the real time /
        efficiency tradeoff.
    </p>
    <p>
        What do I hope to gain by typing angle brackets like an animal? A greater understanding of and attention to HTML
        best practices and standard-compliant markup, for one. A quicker deployment process if I go for months without
        touching this site again without needing to re-learn how to run whatever static site generator is being run
        under the hood. Mostly, though? All the serious street-cred that will come by me telling people that I update my
        website in the old-world, hand-crafted, artisanal manner.
